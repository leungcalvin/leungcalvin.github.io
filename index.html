    <h1> Calvin Leung </h1>
    <p> As of the time of this writing, I am a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow and a rising fifth-year PhD candidate at MIT in the Department of Physics. I am a member of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration, and my advisor is <a href="http://www.kiyomasui.info">Kiyo Masui</a>. My research program centers on the observation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and developing techniques to use them as probes of the large scale structure of the universe. </p>

    <h2> Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Activism </h2>
    I am proud to have been an outspoken and active organizer for the MIT Graduate Student Union since its inception in 2018. We are now one of the largest graduate student bargaining units in the country.
