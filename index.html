    <h1> Calvin Leung </h1>
    <p> As of the time of this writing, I am a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow and a rising fifth-year PhD candidate at MIT in the Department of Physics. I am a member of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration, and my advisor is <a href="http://www.kiyomasui.info">Kiyo Masui</a>. My research program centers on the observation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and developing techniques to use them as probes of the large scale structure of the universe, with particular emphasis on gravitational lensing. 

    Nevertheless, I maintain very broad scientific interests. I am always happy to have conversations about quantum optics, the foundations of quantum mechanics, and new developments in atomic physics.</p>
    <p> Email me at [three-letter acronym for fast radio burst] [at symbol] mit.edu  </p>

    <h2>First and co-first author papers</h2>
    <p> My expertise is in very long baseline interferometric localizations of FRBs and using FRBs in gravitational lensing.

    I am proud to have been an outspoken and active organizer for the MIT Graduate Student Union since its inception in 2018. We now represent one of the largest graduate student bargaining units in the country. I was a member of the MIT Kavli Institute Anti-Racism Task Force formed as an institutional response to ShutDownSTEM during the Strike for Black Lives in 2020, as well as a member of the student support group PhysREFS (Resources for Easing Friction and Stress) since 2018.
