Currently, their progenitors and production mechanism are unknown, and their millisecond-scale duration makes localization for multiwavelength followup extremely challenging. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment-FRB Instrument [2] leads the field in FRB detection but its arcminute-precision localization is insufficient for host galaxy association. We have devel- oped hardware and software for CHIME/FRB outrigger telescopes, which will provide more precise localizations through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We use the CHIME Pathfinder [1] as an outrigger testbed to demonstrate a synoptic VLBI calibration technique for CHIME/FRB. We demonstrate the interferometric detec- tion of a single FRB between the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and the CHIME Pathfinder while the two telescopes were operating independently and on separate clocks, as in a true VLBI observation. Using a simultaneous observation of the calibrator 3C 305, we measure the FRBâ€™s arrival time difference at the two telescopes with a precision of 15 picoseconds, meeting key hardware, software, and calibration require- ments for performing VLBI with CHIME/FRB outriggers. Such outriggers will enable thousands of FRBs to be localized to milliarcsecond precision, enabling transformative studies of their host environments.","tags":[],"title":"Demonstration of a Synoptic VLBI Technique for Localizing a Non-Repeating Fast Radio Burst with CHIME/FRB","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593599513,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593599513,"objectID":"543d10af0c7853ba42a0089bdcbc5c45","permalink":"/talk/netcgf2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-05T02:31:53-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/netcgf2020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Localizing CHIME/FRB's Fast Radio Bursts for Cosmology","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572631200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572631200,"objectID":"4fc3bb06c83140e4a11883228d28925e","permalink":"/talk/neroc2019/","publishdate":"2020-12-05T02:31:48-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/neroc2019/","section":"talk","summary":"The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is poised to discover thousands of FRBs over the course of its lifetime, but only has arcminute-scale angular resolution.
