That conflict is expressed by Bell’s inequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no statistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and anything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous experiments, this “freedom of choice” was addressed by ensuring that selection of measurement settings via conventional “quantum random number generators” was spacelike separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left open the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices and measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each experimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell’s inequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as “cosmic setting generators.” In our tests with polarization-entangled photons, measurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way stars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all detected photons, and that each stellar photon’s color was set at emission, we observe statistically significant ≳ 7.31 σ and ≳ 11.93 σ violations of Bell’s inequality with estimated p values of ≲ 1.8e-13 and ≲ 4.0e-33 , respectively, thereby pushing back by ∼ 600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist influences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.","tags":[],"title":"Cosmic Bell Test: Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rauch","et al."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607933865,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607933865,"objectID":"6a2ce2550cd83ed6353b9ca5d597f1f6","permalink":"leungcalvin.github.io/publication/rauch2018cosmic/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T00:17:45-08:00","relpermalink":"leungcalvin.github.io/publication/rauch2018cosmic/","section":"publication","summary":"In this Letter, we present a cosmic Bell experiment with polarization-entangled photons, in which measurement settings were determined based on real-time measurements of the wavelength of photons from high-redshift quasars, whose light was emitted billions of years ago; the experiment simultaneously ensures locality.

Of course not! To high-energy physics, optical and near-infrared photons are basically the same.

Building on the design of an astronomical random number generator developed for the recent cosmic Bell experiment [Handsteiner et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 060401 (2017)], in this paper we report on the design and characterization of a device that, with 20-nanosecond latency, outputs a bit based on whether the wavelength of an incoming photon is greater than or less than ≈ 700 nm. Using the one-meter telescope at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table Mountain Observatory, we generated random bits from astronomical photons in both color channels from 50 stars of varying color and magnitude, and from 12 quasars with redshifts up to z = 3.9 . With stars, we achieved bit rates of ∼ 1 × 10^6 Hz / m 2 , limited by saturation of our single-photon detectors, and with quasars of magnitudes between 12.9 and 16, we achieved rates between ∼ 10^2 and 2 × 10^3 Hz / m 2 . For bright quasars, the resulting bitstreams exhibit sufficiently low amounts of statistical predictability as quantified by the mutual information. In addition, a sufficiently high fraction of bits generated are of true astronomical origin in order to address both the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes when used to set the measurement settings in a test of the Bell-CHSH inequality.","tags":[],"title":"Astronomical Random Numbers for Quantum Foundations Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"To help test quantum physics, a new method generates random numbers using light from distant stars and quasars that presumably have no correlation with experiments on Earth.
