<h1>Music</h1>

<h2>Completed</h2>
I've worked through these in some detail and would recommend them.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Rachmaninoff</strong> - Sonata for Cello and Piano (what an epic journey!)</li>
        <li><strong>Smetana</strong> - String Quartet #1 (I love this, especially the jolly second movement)</li>
        <li><strong>Kodaly</strong> - Duo for Violin and Cello (This grew on me the more I played it)</li>
        <li><strong>Tchaikovsky</strong> - Piano Trio #1 (Quite a marathon, and maybe my favorite chamber piece of all time. I don't know when I'll play it next.)</li>
        <li><strong>Brahms</strong> - Piano Quartet #1 (I thought this was wild until I saw Schoenberg's orchestral arrangement of it. I especially love Mvt. 3)</li>
        <le><strong>Mendelssohn</strong> - Octet #1 (No, I have not played Mvt 4, but I will someday.)
        <li><strong>Schumann</strong> - Piano Quintet #1 (Barely played this due to COVID-19)</li>
        <li><strong>Schubert</strong> - Piano Trio #2 (This was probably the most difficult thing I've ever performed, maybe aside from the Shostakovich. The famous second movement is based on a haunting Finnish folk song)</li>
        <li><strong>Shostakovich</strong> - Piano Trio #2 (I am still scared of the opening cello solo)</li>
        <li><strong>Schumann</strong> - Piano Quartet #1 (second movement is the best)</li>
        <li><strong>Beethoven</strong> - Piano Trio (Archduke) #7 (third movement is the best)</li>
        <li><strong>Brahms</strong> - Piano Quintet #1 (The piano/cello/violin moment in Mvt. 2 is sublime)</li>
        <li><strong>Mendelssohn</strong> - Piano Trio #2 (Buy a new C string for this)</li>
	<li><strong>Martinu</strong> - Piano Trio #1 (weirdly catchy but <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2021/featured-video-musical-encore-re-imagined-library-1129>anxiety inducing</a>) </li>
    </ol>
